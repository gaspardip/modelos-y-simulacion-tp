# Fix Phase Normalization in utils.py
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 92008

## Original Todo
SCIENTIFIC BUG: utils.py línea 73 usa cp.remainder que puede causar discontinuidades, debe usar thetas % (2*np.pi) para normalización correcta de fases

## Description
We need to fix the phase normalization in the Kuramoto model simulation to avoid discontinuities. Currently, `utils.py` uses `cp.remainder()` which implements IEEE remainder and can introduce numerical artifacts. We'll replace it with the modulo operator `%` for consistent behavior with the rest of the codebase.

The issue affects the RK4 integration step where phases are normalized after each update. While mathematically equivalent for the Kuramoto dynamics (since sin/cos are periodic), the discontinuous wrapping can reduce numerical accuracy and introduce spurious effects near phase transitions.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Replace `cp.remainder(thetas, two_pi, out=thetas)` with `thetas %= two_pi` in utils.py:73
- [x] Verify phase normalization consistency across visualization scripts
- [x] Run Script 1 (complete graph analysis) to ensure results remain stable
- [x] Run Script 4 (statistical analysis) to verify no regression in synchronization detection (requires CUDA)
- [x] Compare order parameter evolution before/after the change (requires CUDA)
- [x] Document the fix with a comment explaining why modulo is preferred

## Notes
- The fix replaces `cp.remainder()` with the modulo operator `%` for phase normalization
- This ensures consistency with visualization scripts that already use `%`
- The change avoids potential discontinuities from IEEE remainder behavior
- Testing requires CUDA GPU as the scripts use CuPy for acceleration
- The comment was updated to explain why modulo is preferred
