- **Fused RK4 Integration**: Combined neighbor computation and 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration in single kernel launch
- **CSR Sparse Matrix Optimization**: Efficient neighbor access using compressed sparse row format for network adjacency

### Phase 2: Advanced GPU Optimizations (Achieved: Additional 1.96x speedup over Phase 1)
**Architecture-adaptive optimizations with automatic fallback mechanisms**
- **GPU Architecture Detection**: Automatic detection of compute capability and optimization selection (Hopper/Ampere/modern/legacy)
- **Warp Shuffle Reductions**: Parallel neighbor summation using shuffle operations, reducing 32 values in log₂(32) = 5 steps
- **Fast Math Operations**: Hardware-accelerated arithmetic using __fdividef, __fadd_rn, __fmul_rn for improved throughput
- **Cache-Optimized Memory Access**: Read-only cache utilization with __ldg for constant parameters (K_values, omegas, degrees)
- **Memory Hierarchy Optimization**: Shared memory utilization for frequently accessed neighbor phase data
- **Collaborative Loading**: Thread block cooperation for loading phase data into shared memory to improve cache hit rates
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation to Phase 1 performance on unsupported hardware

### Combined Achievement: ~100,000x speedup over sequential CPU implementation
**Measured performance on 15K node networks: 98.12 billion operations/second**
